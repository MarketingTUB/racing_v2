Javascript Pseudo 3D Racer
==========================

This is an adaption of Jake Gordons pseudo-3d racing game [(source)](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-racer), modified for research purposes at TU Berlin.

Original notes on code structure
================================

This project happens to be implemented in javascript (because its easy for prototyping) but
is not intended to demonstrate javascript techniques or best practices. In fact, in order to
keep it simple to understand it embeds the javascript for each example directly in the HTML
page (horror!) and, even worse, uses global variables and functions (OMG!).

If I was building a real game I would have much more structure and organization to the
code, but since its just a racing game tech demo, I have elected to [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
